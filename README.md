My personal website.

It is based on the [Jekyll Now theme](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) ([github repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)).

This Jekyll static site is hosted on AWS S3 with CloudFront.
Changes can be pushed to AWS S3 conveniently with the [s3_website gem](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website).
Just do:

```
s3_website push
```
