  abstract = "The study of healthy brain development helps to better understand
              both brain transformation and connectivity patterns, which happen
              during childhood to adulthood. This study presents a sparse
              machine learning solution across whole-brain functional
              connectivity (FC) measures of three data sets, derived from
              resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and
              two task fMRI data including a working memory n-back task
              (nb-fMRI) and an emotion identification task (em-fMRI). The fMRI
              data are collected from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental
              Cohort (PNC) for the prediction of brain age in adolescents. Due
              to extremely large variable-to-instance ratio of PNC data, a high
              dimensional matrix with several irrelevant and highly correlated
              features is generated, and hence a sparse learning approach is
              necessary to extract effective features from fMRI data. We
              propose a sparse learner based on the residual errors along the
              estimation of an inverse problem for extreme learning machine
              (ELM). Our proposed method is able to overcome the overlearning
              problem by pruning several redundant features and their
              corresponding output weights. The proposed multimodal sparse ELM
              classifier based on residual errors (RES-ELM) is highly
              competitive in terms of classification accuracy compared to its
              counterparts such as conventional ELM, and sparse Bayesian
              learning ELM.",
