  abstract = "Reducing the number of false positive discoveries is presently
              one of the most pressing issues in the life sciences. It is of
              especially great importance for many applications in neuroimaging
              and genomics, where datasets are typically high-dimensional,
              which means that the number of explanatory variables exceeds the
              sample size. The false discovery rate (FDR) is a criterion that
              can be employed to address that issue. Thus it has gained great
              popularity as a tool for testing multiple hypotheses. Canonical
              correlation analysis (CCA) is a statistical technique that is
              used to make sense of the cross-correlation of two sets of
              measurements collected on the same set of samples (e.g., brain
              imaging and genomic data for the same mental illness patients),
              and sparse CCA extends the classical method to high-dimensional
              settings. Here we propose a way of applying the FDR concept to
              sparse CCA, and a method to control the FDR. The proposed FDR
              correction directly influences the sparsity of the solution,
              adapting it to the unknown true sparsity level. Theoretical
              derivation as well as simulation studies show that our procedure
              indeed keeps the FDR of the canonical vectors below a
              user-specified target level. We apply the proposed method to an
              imaging genomics dataset from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental
              Cohort. Our results link the brain connectivity profiles derived
              from brain activity during an emotion identification task, as
              measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to the
              corresponding subjects' genomic data.",
