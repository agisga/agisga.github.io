  abstract      = "A novel resampling framework is proposed to evaluate the
                   robustness and generalization capability of deep learning
                   models with respect to distribution shift. We use Auto
                   Encoder Variational Bayes to find a latent representation of
                   the data, on which a Variational Gaussian Mixture Model is
                   applied to deliberately create distribution shift by
                   dividing the dataset into different clusters. Wasserstein
                   distance is used to characterize the extent of distribution
                   shift between the training and the testing data splits. We
                   compare several conventional Convolutional Neural Network
                   (CNN) architectures as well as Bayesian CNN models for image
                   classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset to assess their
                   robustness under the deliberately created distribution
                   shift.",
