Linking the visually perceivable properties with the more mathematically abstract ones helps greatly in building an intuition for a mathematical concept at hand.
The above figure shows the shapes of the multivariate normal density in two dimensions for different values of $\mu$, $\sigma_1^2$, $\sigma_2^2$, and $\rho$. In the following I explain why the contour plots look the way they do.
