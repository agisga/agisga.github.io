title: Turn an old laptop into a home server with remote access over VPN

This weekend I have set up an old laptop with a broken screen as an [Amahi](https://www.amahi.org/) server in my house, such that I can access the files stored on the server with my other computers from anywhere.[^1] I use OpenVPN to establish a connection to the server and its files. As an additional benefit, [connecting over a VPN when on a public network secures the traffic to and from you](https://www.expressvpn.com/internet-privacy/guides/vpn-security-work/).

I have no previous experience with server setup, and it turned out to take longer than I expected. It was quite a frustrating experience, I must admit :unamused:. Therefore I decided to document the final setup for future-me or anybody else interested in doing something similar. I'm by no means an expert on any of that (just to make it clear), but everything works to my satisfaction now :satisfied:.

### Here are the steps to reproduce my setup


1. Install Amahi. Well, first install *the correct version of Fedora* (_not_ the latest release). I am using [Amahi 9 on Fedora 23](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_9_Install), which is currently the officially supported setup.

2. Put the IP of your server into the address bar of a web browser in another machine on the local network (the IP can be determined with `hostname -I` in the server's console). This will bring you to a login screen of the web interface of your server.
Here I experienced some buggy behavior: The web interface would not accept my credentials, until [I reset my Amahi password](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Reset_Amahi_Password) over an SSH session.

3. Use the web interface to create additional [file shares](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Storage_and_file_sharing#Step_2:_Create_Shares) and users, and to install apps by point-and-click onto the Amahi server.

3. Now, [the Amahi wiki suggests to turn off your router's DHCP, in order to use the home server for DNS](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Transition_to_Amahi). However, in my final setup I skipped that step, since I don't use any Amahi apps other than the OpenVPN (which does not require this step). But if you decide to do this, then take a look at [the wiki page on network troubleshooting](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Network_troubleshooting) first.

4. Pay 5$ for the [OpenVPN app](https://www.amahi.org/apps/openvpn) (most [Amahi server apps](https://www.amahi.org/apps) are offered free of cost, but some require a "convenience fee for one-click installation"). 

4. [Install OpenVPN](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/OpenVPN). 

5. [Get VPN clients for your computers/devices](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/OpenVPN_clients). I use [my laptop and my work computer (both Linux machines)](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/VPNLinux) to log into the server remotely.

6. You can access your file shares with an ordinary file browser / finder / file manager (obviously you need to start OpenVPN first, if outside the home network).

---------------------

   [^1]: Initially I got the idea for a home server after an email from Dropbox informed me that my promotional 48 GB of storage space expire in a month. Instead of paying one of the numerous cloud storage providers, I decided to host an [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com/) at home (after [some](http://lifehacker.com/5993596/how-to-set-up-your-own-private-cloud-storage-service-in-five-minutes-with-owncloud) [guides](http://lifehacker.com/turn-an-old-pc-into-a-nas-vpn-media-streamer-and-mor-1516484110) online made it sound easier than it actually is...). Unfortunately, ownCloud on an Amahi server turned out to be quite disappointing. I found ownCloud to lack some functionality and to be very inconvenient in certain ways, and [it possibly poses a security risk when accessible from outside the local network](https://forums.amahi.org/viewtopic.php?t=4956). So, I eventually got rid of ownCloud, and retreated to storing my files directly on the server in [file shares](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Storage_and_file_sharing#Step_2:_Create_Shares).
