This is my cheat sheet of the essential methods of the R package [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html). It turns out that dplyr is intuitive to the point where I won't probably need to use this cheat sheet. The following was compiled in [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) [[:page_facing_up: download .Rmd file]({{ site.baseurl }}/public_files/dplyr_basics.Rmd)].
