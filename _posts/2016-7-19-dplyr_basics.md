This blog post demonstrates the usage of the R package [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html). It turns out that dplyr is intuitive to the point where I probably won't ever need to look back at this summary. A nice and very concise [dplyr and tidyr cheat sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) is available from RStudio. 

The following was compiled in [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) [[:page_facing_up: download .Rmd file]({{ site.baseurl }}/public_files/dplyr_basics.Rmd)].
