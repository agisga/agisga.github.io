      <h1><a href="/AWS_S3_and_CloudFront/">Setting up an HTTPS static site using AWS S3 and Cloudfront (and also Jekyll and s3_website)</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>For a while now I wanted to migrate my websites away from Github pages.
While Github provides an excellent free service, there are some limitations to its capabilities, and the longer I wait the harder (or the more inconvenient) it becomes to migrate away from gh-pages.
AWS S3 + CloudFront is a widely-used alternative that has been around for a long time.
Moreover, I was planning to get more familiar with AWS at all levels anyway.
So, it’s a great learning opportunity too.</p>

      <h1><a href="/deep-learning-self-study/">Neural networks and deep learning — self-study and 2 presentations</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Last month, after mentioning “deep learning” a few times to some professors, I suddenly found myself in a position where I had to prepare three talks about “deep learning” within just one month… <img class="emoji" title=":sweat_smile:" alt=":sweat_smile:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f605.png" height="20" width="20">
This is not to complain. I actually strongly enjoy studying the relevant theory, applying it to interesting datasets, and presenting what I have learned.
Besides, teaching may be the best way to learn.
However, it is quite funny. <img class="emoji" title=":laughing:" alt=":laughing:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f606.png" height="20" width="20">
The deep learning hype is too real. <img class="emoji" title=":trollface:" alt=":trollface:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/trollface.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

      <h1><a href="/auc/">Probabilistic interpretation of AUC</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Unfortunately this was not taught in any of my statistics or data analysis classes at university (wtf it so needs to be <img class="emoji" title=":scream_cat:" alt=":scream_cat:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f640.png" height="20" width="20">).
So it took me some time until I learned that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve">AUC</a> has a nice probabilistic meaning.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.uspto.gov">The United States Patent and Trademark office (USPTO)</a> provides <em>immense</em> amounts of data (the data I used are in the form of XML files).

      <h1><a href="/Freedmans_paradox/">Freedman's paradox</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Recently I came across the classical 1983 paper <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~gasweete/crj604/readings/1983-Freedman%20(Screening%20Regression%20Equations).pdf"><em>A note on screening regression equations</em></a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Freedman">David Freedman</a>. Freedman shows in an impressive way the dangers of data reuse in statistical analyses. The potentially dangerous scenarios include those where the results of one statistical procedure performed on the data are fed into another procedure performed on the same data. As a concrete example Freedman considers the practice of performing variable selection first, and then fitting another model using only the identified variables on the same data that was used to identify them in the first place. Because of the unexpectedly high severity of the problem this phenomenon became known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman%27s_paradox">“Freedman’s paradox”</a>. Moreover, in his paper Freedman derives asymptotic estimates for the resulting errors.</p>

        <p>A reviewer asked me to report detailed running times for all (so many <img class="emoji" title=":scream:" alt=":scream:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f631.png" height="20" width="20">) performed computations in one of my papers, and so I spent a Saturday morning figuring out my favorite way to benchmark R code.

      <h1><a href="/the-lean-phd-student/">The Lean PhD Student — Can The Lean Startup principles be applied to personal productivity in graduate school?</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>The lean startup methodology consists of a set of principles that were proposed and popularized by Eric Ries in the book <em>The Lean Startup</em> (and elsewhere). He believes that startup success can be engineered by following the lean startup methodology. Eric Ries defines a startup as “a human institution designed to deliver a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty”. If we replace “product or service” by “research result”, that sounds awfully similar to what a PhD student has to do. Indeed, the similarities between being a junior researcher, such as a PhD student, and running a startup have been often pointed out (for example: <a href="http://pgbovine.net/research-and-startup.htm">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.bench2business.com/5-ways-start-up-life-is-similar-to-academia/">[2]</a>, <a href="https://pragmaticstartup.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/similarities-between-an-entrepreneur-and-an-academic/">[3]</a>). In light of this, I propose that <em>the lean startup methodology</em> can also be applied to academic pursuits of a PhD student. Below, I adapt some of the most important lean startup concepts for application to a junior researcher’s personal productivity and academic success.<sup id="fnref:nonexperimental"><a href="#fn:nonexperimental" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

      <h1><a href="/tensor_decomposition_tucker/">Understanding the Tucker decomposition, and compressing tensor-valued data (with R code)</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In many applications, data naturally form an <em>n</em>-way tensor with <em>n &gt; 2</em>, rather than a “tidy” table.
As mentioned in the beginning of <a href="/tensor_decomposition_CP/">my last blog post</a>, a tensor is essentially a multi-dimensional array:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a tensor of order one is a vector, which simply is a column of numbers,</li>
  <li>a tensor of order two is a matrix, which is basically numbers arranged in a rectangle,</li>
  <li>a tensor of order three looks like numbers arranged in rectangular box (or a cube, if all modes have the same dimension),</li>
  <li>an <em>n</em>th order (or <em>n</em>-way) tensor looks like numbers arranged in an <em>n</em>-hyperrectangle… you get the idea…</li>
