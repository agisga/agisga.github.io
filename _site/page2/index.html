      <div class="entry">
        <p>Lately I notice a sharp increase in my coffee consumption (reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pour-Your-Heart-Into-Starbucks/dp/0786883561/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487141175&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=howard+schultz">Howard Schultz’s Starbucks book</a>, which is actually quite good by the way, does not help either :grimacing:). Having recently transitioned into a new PhD program I started wondering whether my increased coffee consumption has something to do with my higher stress levels in the last few weeks, and how that conjecture generalizes to the rest of my grad school experience. To answer that question I decided to take a look at how much money I have spent at coffee houses over the last few years. …Also, I’m right now over-caffeinated at 1:40am and I have nothing better to do anyway. :smile:</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Lately I was getting a little bored with genomic data (and then TCGA2STAT started to give me a segfault on my university’s high performance computing facility too :stuck_out_tongue:). So I decided to analyze some brain imaging data that I had lying around instead. The first step is to do some visual data exploration. In this blog post I present some functions which I was able to find for MRI visualization in R, and which I found to be very useful. All functions presented below presuppose an image in the <a href="https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/">NIfTI data format</a> as input, and are very user-friendly.</p>

      <h1><a href="/amahi/">Turn an old laptop into a home server with remote access over VPN</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>This weekend I have set up an old laptop with a broken screen as an <a href="https://www.amahi.org/">Amahi</a> server in my house, such that I can access the files stored on the server with my other computers from anywhere.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I use OpenVPN to establish a connection to the server and its files. As an additional benefit, <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/internet-privacy/guides/vpn-security-work/">connecting over a VPN when on a public network secures the traffic to and from you</a>.</p>

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Initially I got the idea for a home server after an email from Dropbox informed me that my promotional 48 GB of storage space expire in a month. Instead of paying one of the numerous cloud storage providers, I decided to host an <a href="https://owncloud.com/">ownCloud</a> at home (after <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5993596/how-to-set-up-your-own-private-cloud-storage-service-in-five-minutes-with-owncloud">some</a> <a href="http://lifehacker.com/turn-an-old-pc-into-a-nas-vpn-media-streamer-and-mor-1516484110">guides</a> online made it sound easier than it actually is…). Unfortunately, ownCloud on an Amahi server turned out to be quite disappointing. I found ownCloud to lack some functionality and to be very inconvenient in certain ways, and <a href="https://forums.amahi.org/viewtopic.php?t=4956">it possibly poses a security risk when accessible from outside the local network</a>. So, I eventually got rid of ownCloud, and retreated to storing my files directly on the server in <a href="https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Storage_and_file_sharing#Step_2:_Create_Shares">file shares</a>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
