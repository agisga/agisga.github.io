      <div class="entry">
        <p>Unfortunately this was not taught in any of my statistics or data analysis classes at university (wtf it so needs to be <img class="emoji" title=":scream_cat:" alt=":scream_cat:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f640.png" height="20" width="20">).
So it took me some until I learned that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve">AUC</a> has a nice probabilistic meaning.</p>

      <h1><a href="/Freedmans_paradox/">Freedman's paradox</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Recently I came across the classical 1983 paper <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~gasweete/crj604/readings/1983-Freedman%20(Screening%20Regression%20Equations).pdf"><em>A note on screening regression equations</em></a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Freedman">David Freedman</a>. Freedman shows in an impressive way the dangers of data reuse in statistical analyses. The potentially dangerous scenarios include those where the results of one statistical procedure performed on the data are fed into another procedure performed on the same data. As a concrete example Freedman considers the practice of performing variable selection first, and then fitting another model using only the identified variables on the same data that was used to identify them in the first place. Because of the unexpectedly high severity of the problem this phenomenon became known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman%27s_paradox">“Freedman’s paradox”</a>. Moreover, in his paper Freedman derives asymptotic estimates for the resulting errors.</p>

        <p>A reviewer asked me to report detailed running times for all (so many <img class="emoji" title=":scream:" alt=":scream:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f631.png" height="20" width="20">) performed computations in one of my papers, and so I spent a Saturday morning figuring out my favorite way to benchmark R code.

      <h1><a href="/tensor_decomposition_tucker/">Understanding the Tucker decomposition, and compressing tensor-valued data (with R code)</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In many applications, data naturally form an <em>n</em>-way tensor with <em>n &gt; 2</em>, rather than a “tidy” table.
As mentioned in the beginning of <a href="http://www.alexejgossmann.com/tensor_decomposition_CP/">my last blog post</a>, a tensor is essentially a multi-dimensional array:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a tensor of order one is a vector, which simply is a column of numbers,</li>
  <li>a tensor of order two is a matrix, which is basically numbers arranged in a rectangle,</li>
  <li>a tensor of order three looks like numbers arranged in rectangular box (or a cube, if all modes have the same dimension),</li>
  <li>an <em>n</em>th order (or <em>n</em>-way) tensor looks like numbers arranged in an <em>n</em>-hyperrectangle… you get the idea…</li>

      <h1><a href="/grad-school-and-coffee/">Tired of doing real math 2 — grad school and coffee consumption</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Lately I notice a sharp increase in my coffee consumption (reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pour-Your-Heart-Into-Starbucks/dp/0786883561/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487141175&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=howard+schultz">Howard Schultz’s Starbucks book</a>, which is actually quite good by the way, does not help either <img class="emoji" title=":grimacing:" alt=":grimacing:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f62c.png" height="20" width="20">). Having recently transitioned into a new PhD program I started wondering whether my increased coffee consumption has something to do with my higher stress levels in the last few weeks, and how that conjecture generalizes to the rest of my grad school experience. To answer that question I decided to take a look at how much money I have spent at coffee houses over the last few years. …Also, I’m right now over-caffeinated at 1:40am and I have nothing better to do anyway. <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

      <h1><a href="/MRI_viz/">Visualization of MRI data in R</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Lately I was getting a little bored with genomic data (and then TCGA2STAT started to give me a segfault on my university’s high performance computing facility too <img class="emoji" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f61b.png" height="20" width="20">). So I decided to analyze some brain imaging data that I had lying around instead. The first step is to do some visual data exploration. In this blog post I present some functions which I was able to find for MRI visualization in R, and which I found to be very useful. All functions presented below presuppose an image in the <a href="https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/">NIfTI data format</a> as input, and are very user-friendly.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>A couple of weeks ago I have released my first R package on CRAN. For me it turned out to be a far less painful process than many people on the internet portray it to be (even though the package uses quite a lot of C++ code via Rcpp and RcppEigen, and even though R CMD check returns two NOTEs). Some of the most helpful resources for publishing the package were:</p>
