I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at Tulane University in New Orleans. My research interests lie in statistics and machine learning, and their application in imaging and genomics. My focus currently includes regularized regression methods for feature selection and prediction, and network or pathway based methods. I am also very interested in programming. Previously I have earned a BS in mathematics at Technische Universitaet Darmstadt in Germany in 2012, and completed a Masterâ€™s degree in statistics at Tulane University in Spring 2014. You can read my [CV](http://dauns.math.tulane.edu/~agossman/pdfs/Alexej_Gossmann-CV.pdf).
