I am a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at Tulane University in New Orleans. My research interests lie in statistics and machine learning, and their application in genomics and imaging. My focus currently includes regularized regression methods for feature selection and prediction, mixed models, and network or pathway based methods. I am also very interested in programming. Previously I have earned a BS in mathematics at Technische Universitaet Darmstadt in Germany in 2012, and completed a Masterâ€™s degree in statistics at Tulane University in 2014.

My academic advisors are [Yu-Ping Wang](http://www.tulane.edu/~wyp/) and [Michelle Lacey](http://129.81.170.14/~mlacey/).

In my free time I go to the gym and sometimes play music among other things.

I actually don't mind it when people mispronounce my name. However, if you want to do it right, the "j" in Alexej is pronounced as a "y" (German spelling) and the stress is on the last syllable, and Gossmann has no "r".
