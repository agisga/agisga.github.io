* [`mixed_models`](https://github.com/agisga/mixed_models) &mdash; Fit statistical (linear) models with fixed and mixed (random) effects in Ruby. The package supports the formula language of the R package `lme4` for model specification (a pain to implement), many types of hypotheses tests and confidence intervals for the fixed and random effects coefficients, methods for prediction and prediction intervals, etc. It is my Google Summer Of Code 2015 project and still a work in progress.
