* [`ThresholdoutAUC`](https://github.com/DIDSR/ThresholdoutAUC) &mdash; Something interesting here.[^1]

* [`grpSLOPE`](https://github.com/agisga/grpSLOPE) &mdash; Group SLOPE is a penalized linear regression method that is used for adaptive selection of groups of significant predictors in a high-dimensional linear model. A unique feature of the Group SLOPE method is that it offers (group) false discovery rate control (i.e., control of the expected proportion of irrelevant groups among the total number of groups of predictors selected by the Group SLOPE method). This R package is associated with [Brzyski et. al.(2018) "Group SLOPE - adaptive selection of groups of predictor"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2017.1411269) ([arXiv version](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04960)).

* [`grpSLOPEMC`](https://github.com/agisga/grpSLOPEMC) &mdash; This is an extension package to the R package [grpSLOPE](https://cran.r-project.org/package=grpSLOPE). It contains Monte Carlo based methods for the estimation of the regularizing sequence. This R package is associated with [Gossmann et. al. (2017) "A sparse regression method for group-wise feature selection with false discovery rate control"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2017.2780106).

* [`FDRcorrectedSCCA`](https://github.com/agisga/FDRcorrectedSCCA) &mdash; Codes associated with the publication [Gossmann et. al. (2018) "FDR-Corrected Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis with Applications to Imaging Genomics"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2018.2815583) ([arXiv version](http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04312)) with all methods and algorithms organized as functions in an R package for convenience.

* [`mixed_models`](https://github.com/agisga/mixed_models) &mdash; Fit statistical (linear) models with fixed and mixed (random) effects in Ruby. The package supports the formula language of the R package `lme4` for model specification (a pain to implement), many types of hypotheses tests and confidence intervals for the fixed and random effects coefficients, methods for prediction and prediction intervals, etc. [It is my Google Summer Of Code 2015 project]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2015-8-19-gsoc-2015-mixed_models.markdown %}).

* [`spitzy`](https://github.com/agisga/spitzy) &mdash; Spitzy is the name of a cute Pomeranian. Spitzy reads backwards as *yztips*, which translates into: **Y**our **Z**appy-**T**appy **I**nitial and boundary value **P**artial (and ordinary) differential equation **S**olver.  It is my collection of numerical methods for differential equations written in Ruby.

* When I have some free time, I like to contribute code to open source software projects (mostly, related to mathematics, statistics or machine learning). Visit my [github page](https://github.com/agisga) for the projects that I contribute to.
