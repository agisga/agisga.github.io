* [`grpSLOPE`](https://github.com/agisga/grpSLOPE) &mdash; Group SLOPE is a penalized linear regression method that is used for adaptive selection of groups of significant predictors in a high-dimensional linear model. A unique feature of the Group SLOPE method is that it offers (group) false discovery rate control (i.e., control of the expected proportion of irrelevant groups among the total number of groups of predictors selected by the Group SLOPE method).

* [`mixed_models`](https://github.com/agisga/mixed_models) &mdash; Fit statistical (linear) models with fixed and mixed (random) effects in Ruby. The package supports the formula language of the R package `lme4` for model specification (a pain to implement), many types of hypotheses tests and confidence intervals for the fixed and random effects coefficients, methods for prediction and prediction intervals, etc. It is my Google Summer Of Code 2015 project and still a work in progress.

* [`spitzy`](https://github.com/agisga/spitzy) &mdash; Spitzy is the name of a cute Pomeranian. Spitzy reads backwards as *yztips*, which translates into: **Y**our **Z**appy-**T**appy **I**nitial and boundary value **P**artial (and ordinary) differential equation **S**olver.  It is my collection of numerical methods for differential equations written in Ruby.
